## Projects

### Penguin Rush
Penguin Rush is a top-down fast-pace arena game made by unity engine. It was the course project of University of Toronto CSC404. I developed this game with 4 other programmers and 3 artists. This game is still under development after the course, and we aim to present this game at [levelupshowcase](https://levelupshowcase.com/) on April 4, 2018. Come and check us out!

### Somnus.
Ghost Recall System is a text based advanture game made by unity engine. This is the graduation project of Peng Bo, a former student of China Academy of Art. I was invited to provide technical support as the only developer.
